LunchTrain website for CS169, Fall 2011. 
The service should run as-is if downloaded. 
base.php contains the MySQL setup, and create.sql is what needs to be fed into the database to instantiate the tables. 
Along with MySQL, PHP and Apache need to be activated for the website to work. 
A version of LunchTrain can be found on http://107.20.135.212/journal/LunchTrain/ hosted by Amazon EC2 .
